            During my contract at Jaworski Software Solutions I developed a full stack feature-rich, fully extendable
            and customisable <a href="/commercial/node-editor/">node editor web application</a>. I was responsible for setting up
            the project from the ground up using Blazor, Entity Framework Core, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL utilising best
            practices and clean architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application was designed to facilitate easy extending with no unnecessary boilerplate. Integration of
            other APIs was made trivial, supporting dependency injection and multiple ways of registering new behaviour.
            Nodes execution maximises parallel processing, and can be fully customised by the consumer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was also in charge of developing the frontend of a Next.js <a href="/commercial/ztdw/">website for an upholstery company</a>, including creating
            a trivially editable serialisation model for the displayed content, and styling components using Tailwind CSS.

            During my time at XR Games I was working on <a href="/commercial/starship-troopers/">Starship Troopers: Continuum</a>: a VR, story-driven, multiplayer co-op
            first-person shooter in the universe of the famous IP. I designed and implemented reusable, optimised
            code to ensure seamless networked gameplay across multiple platforms. Working closely with designers, I
            paid close attention to developing user-friendly tooling allowing for implementing in-game behaviour
            efficiently. I was responsible for solely developing and polishing advanced game features from concept to
            completion.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work included implementing a networked narrative system responsible for executing and sychronising
            events and objectives across the entire game, engineering flexible and feature-rich enemy spawning
            and behaviour systems. I also integrated platform-specific features such as headset rumble, eye tracking,
            and adaptive triggers for PSVR2Â®. Additionally, I optimised runtime performance and loading times to meet
            strict platform requirements, overcoming engine limitations for smooth scene transitions. My contributions
            extended to various miscellaneous gameplay elements, including character customization, dialogue system,
            world interactions, collectibles, and more.

            As an independent creator, I have developed and published <a href="https://blendermarket.com/creators/pawel-wilczewski">three financially successful add-ons</a> for Blender
            within the past two years. I provide consistent support, release updates, resolve issues and respond to
            customers. Clean code and pre-planned designing techniques came especially helpful to ensure new features
            and fixes can be implemented when needed.
            I am determined to only publish good quality products and I have received very positive feedback for
            my work.

                I started my programming journey in 2016. Since then, I have worked on multiple projects in various
                game, web and app development areas. I have been passionate about programming for many years, always
                valuing high quality, robust code with a big emphasis on maintainability.
            </p>

                My latest work experience includes developing a
                <a href="/commercial/starship-troopers/">VR game</a> at XR Games and a
                <a href="/commercial/node-editor/">Blazor application</a> for Jaworski
                Software Solutions. I am the author of

                <a href="https://blendermarket.com/creators/pawel-wilczewski">Blender Market</a>.
                Among other projects, I currently work on <a href="/commercial/modularfps/">ModularFPS</a> &#8212;
                an Unreal Engine 5 template for rapid and quality First Person Shooter development.

                I graduated from the University of Leeds with a First-Class Honours degree in Computer Science in July
                2023. My final year project involved creating a Skeletal Mesh Skinning Tool for real-time 3D Animation.

                I am very hard working, programming is my biggest passion, and I program in most of my free time. I am
                always eager to learn new technologies and improving my coding, always considering feedback I receive.
